Summer Research Intern",
            "Apr 2022 - Oct 2022 · 7 mos",
            "1)Currently I am pursuing my summer research internship under professor Rintu Kumar Gayen through SRFP 2022. My topic of research is Variational AutoEncoder Siamese Network for fusion on Satellite Imagery. 
2)My project idea was to have two satellite images (i.e- C_image & L_image) and to produce Fusion of them using Variational AutoEncoder and Siamese Network.
First train the VAE using several similar images, and produce the decoded image after encoding process of individual C_image and L_Image and store the result as VAE_c ,VAE_l. Then pass the images through VGG16/VGG19 and get the desired result like VGG_c and VGG_l. 
Next we concatenate both the result like:
VGG_VAE_c= VGG_c+VAE_C (USING PYTORCH)
VGG_VAE_l= VGG_l+VAE_l(USING PYTORCH)
Then put both these images into Siamese_concet code and get the desired result. 
3) Also researching on publishing the Research paper and journal on the same. Thankyou to our project lead- Mr. Tamesh Halder, PhD Research Scholar of IIT KGP for assisting me in everything ."
